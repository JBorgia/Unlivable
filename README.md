# Unlivable

Unlivable.space is a CRUD system built using Java and the SpringMVC to log real estate comparisons. Homes are compared using number of floors, bathrooms, bedrooms, square footage, etc, but are also compared based on the utilitarianism of their layouts. As it would be impossible to expect real estate agents to have access to digital floorplans or even for those plans to be parseable into comparitable data, users are asked to include square footage of "unlivable" space (hallways, staircases, landings, ect) as well as how many of the bathrooms are attached to bedrooms. This information is used to calculate what percentage of the home is livable and how well its features are for renting. The idea is that for small to moderate sized homes, high percentages of "unlivable" space indicate a poor layout and ultimately that for similar homes, a house with a higher livable space ratio would be a better value. Properties can be searched for by any subset of address criteria. Front end work is basic HTML5 with additional features to be implemented using JavaScript and AngularJS.
